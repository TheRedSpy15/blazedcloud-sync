# Notice
This project is still in it's **very** early stages and is set to a low priority. the mobile apps and the web portal are currently the main focus

This project also is a CLI (command line interface) program. The idea being it makes the program "lighter" with it's function being very simple, a GUI (graphical user interface) is not needed. However a GUI version is planned. But it is still in the planning phase

# Usage

The desktop sync tool is distributed in `.zip` files. Download the correct one for your operating system, extract, and run the release executable. If you are on Windows, it will be `release.exe`. It is **recomended** to create a shortcut to this file
